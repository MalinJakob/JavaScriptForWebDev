        Hello! My name is Malin Jakob, and I am a sporty and
        <em>very</em> active 26-year-old. I currently live in Gothenburg, but
        I’m originally from Malmö in Skåne. I lived in Malmö with my parents and
        older sister. In Malmö I hung out with my family but then mostly school
        then dance then some more dance. I was dancing around 35 hours per week,
        crazy huh? Now I live with my fiance William and our child Walter.
        Before my adventures in Gothenburg, I lived alone in Stockholm to become
        a professional dancer at the <i>Royal Swedish Ballet School</i>. My
        training lasted for three years, and I graduated with a professional
        dancer’s diploma in June 2018. On that note, I would say I am a girl
        with <em>many</em>
        homes!

        <br />I have worked as both a figure skating coach and a dance teacher
        since I was 10 years old, and I’ve been training myself since I was 3 .
        I have always been a highly engaged and motivated person. <br />
        Besides my passion for training and dance, I also run a business with my
        partner. We operate a small web agency called <b>MW Webbdesign</b>, and
        we have created websites for, among others, the Chalmers student portal
        for Industrial Engineering. I create the design, and my partner takes
        care of the system development.

      <p id="box-p">
        Currently, I am studying my third year of my bachelor
        <i>Cognitive Science</i> at the <i>University of Gothenburg</i>. Within
        my program you can change some courses and right now I changed courses
        so that I could learn HTML and CSS. This is a big turn for me, before I
        have always been about the ind och the body but now i want to learn more
        about the technical part and the coding part. We have had some
        programming before in Python and some coding in our
        <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> courses but I have never
        really liked it until now. I don't know if it is me, having a baby and
        sometimes off, but something happened during my maternity leave. So now…
        A new adventure begins with me starting to understand some code and then
        applying for my master in <i>Interaction Design</i>.
        <strong>Very exciting!</strong>

          <blockquote>The next time your friend or partner chastises you for forgetting
          something important, let them know your brain is just functioning
          correctly. As you can imagine, you will create countless memories
          throughout your life, many of which you will eventually forget. And if
          you were to remember every excruciating detail of your existence—such
          as that embarrassing moment in elementary school—it would not be great
          for your mental well-being. <br> <cite>- 2024 Penn LPS Online at the University of Pennsylvania</cite></blockquote>
