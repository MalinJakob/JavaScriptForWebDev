  <p>Hello! My name is Malin Jakob, and I am a sporty and very active
    26-year-old. I currently live in Gothenburg, but I’m originally from
    Malmö in Skåne. I lived in Malmö with my parents and older sister. My
    family but mostly school then dance then some more dance. I was
    dancing around 35 hours per week, crazy huh? Before my adventures in
    Gothenburg, I lived alone in Stockholm to become a professional dancer
    at the Royal Swedish Ballet School. My training lasted for three
    years, and I graduated with a professional dancer’s diploma in June
    2018. On that note, I would say I am a girl with many homes!

    <br />I have worked as both a figure skating coach and a dance teacher
    since I was 10 years old, and I’ve been training myself since I was 3
    . I have always been a highly engaged and motivated person. <br />
    Besides my passion for training and dance, I also run a business with
    my partner. We operate a small web agency called <b>MW Webbdesign</b>,
    and we have created websites for, among others, the Chalmers student
    portal for Industrial Engineering. I create the design,
    and my partner takes care of the system development.</p>
