          Hello! My name is Malin Jakob, and I am a sporty and
          <em>very</em> active 26-year-old. I currently live in Gothenburg, but
          I’m originally from Malmö in Skåne. I lived in Malmö with my parents and
          older sister. In Malmö I hung out with my family but then mostly school
          then dance then some more dance. I was dancing around 35 hours per week,
          crazy huh? Now I live with my fiance William and our child Walter.
          Before my adventures in Gothenburg, I lived alone in Stockholm to become
          a professional dancer at the <i>Royal Swedish Ballet School</i>. My
          training lasted for three years, and I graduated with a professional
          dancer’s diploma in June 2018. On that note, I would say I am a girl
          with <em>many</em>
          homes!

          <br />I have worked as both a figure skating coach and a dance teacher
          since I was 10 years old, and I’ve been training myself since I was 3 .
          I have always been a highly engaged and motivated person. <br />
          Besides my passion for training and dance, I also run a business with my
          partner. We operate a small web agency called <b>MW Webbdesign</b>, and
          we have created websites for, among others, the Chalmers student portal
          for Industrial Engineering. I create the design, and my partner takes
          care of the system development.

          Currently, I am studying my third year of my bachelor
          <i>Cognitive Science</i> at the <i>University of Gothenburg</i>. Within
          my program you can change some courses and right now I changed courses
          so that I could learn HTML and CSS. This is a big turn for me, before I
          have always been about the ind och the body but now i want to learn more
          about the technical part and the coding part. We have had some
          programming before in Python and some coding in our
          <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> courses but I have never
          really liked it until now. I don't know if it is me, having a baby and
          sometimes off, but something happened during my maternity leave. So now…
          A new adventure begins with me starting to understand some code and then
          applying for my master in <i>Interaction Design</i>.
          <strong>Very exciting!</strong>

          <blockquote>
            The next time your friend or partner chastises you for forgetting
            something important, let them know your brain is just functioning
            correctly. As you can imagine, you will create countless memories
            throughout your life, many of which you will eventually forget. And if
            you were to remember every excruciating detail of your existence—such
            as that embarrassing moment in elementary school—it would not be great
            for your mental well-being. <br />
